Pack your CSS together in a single file to reduce the number of requests per page, while easily maintaining your CSS codebase.

With this script, you can import any number of CSS libraries, that are themselves split in so-called *books*, and pick which *book* you want to use.
Once this is done, simply run the script to *pack* all of these files into a single, minified CSS file.

Alternatively, this library set may be dynamically served and packed on-the-go.
